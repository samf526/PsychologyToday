# Psychology Today

It contains code for my first independent data science project. In this project, I explore mental health-providers' Psychology Today Therapist profiles.

The repository is organized into folders each pertaining to one of three categories: code (for data scraping, cleaning, or exploration), data, and blog posts (the project will be presented and discussed in separate posts on my blog, in the form of Jupyter notebooks).

The folder "code - sampling, scraping, cleaning" can be used to replicate my data scraping and wrangling process. The notebooks featured on my blog can be found in separate "blog - <topic>" folders.
