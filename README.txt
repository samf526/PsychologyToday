This repository / project is a work in progress.

The repository contains code for my first independent data science project. In this project, I explore mental health-providers' Psychology Today Therapist profiles.

The repository is organized into folders each pertaining to one of three categories: code (for data scraping, cleaning, or exploration), data, and blog posts (the project will be presented and discussed in separate posts on my blog, in the form of Jupyter notebooks).
